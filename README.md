# UFOs
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to being able to apply the date filter, users will be able to filter by the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results
Filtering data with the filter button we created makes it very easy for anybody to use our site. It's fast and responsive, it updates the filtered information very quickly. It also has a good looking design!

A great thing about it is that it can apply multiple filters at once!

## Summary
One drawback of our current design is that the filter search is case-sensitive. So if you put in NY as opposed to ny when looking for the state, it won't return the correct info. One recommendation for future development would be to fix it so that it works whether the words are input in upper or lower case letters. A second recommendation would be to allow users to filter by duration of event. People would probably like to see the shortest or longest UFO sightings in an easy way.
